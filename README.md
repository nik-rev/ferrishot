## Features

Run by writing `ferrishot` on the command line.

- Select a region on the screen by left clicking and dragging
- Resize the region by dragging on any of the sides or corners and dragging
- Move the region around by dragging in the center
- `Enter` copies screenshot region to clipboard
- `Ctrl s` saves screenshot region as a file
- `F11` selects the entire monitor
- Instantly copy region to clipboard with `--instant` flag
- Holding `Shift` while resizing or dragging will resize or move the selection 10 times slower
- Size indicator allows setting an absolute width and height for the screenshot
- `Esc` exits

This project is under heavy development, and we have a lot of plans. A list of planned features can be found in [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md).
