## Showcase

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbbfe85-b81e-4f26-9453-545dd1b2ce38>

## Features

Run by typing `ferrishot` on the command line.

### Basic usage

- Select a region on the screen by left clicking and dragging.
- Resize the region by dragging on any of the sides and dragging
- Move the region around by dragging in the center

The selection is surrounded by buttons, each with their own keybinding. Most notably:

- `Enter` copies screenshot to clipboard
- `Ctrl s` saves screenshot to a file. You can choose any valid extension like `.png`, `.webp`, `.jpg`
- `Ctrl u` uploads the screenshot to the internet

#### Image Uploaded

You get a link and a QR Code, so you can easily send it to another device!

<img height="400px" src="assets/image_uploaded_online.webp" />

### Size Indicator

In the bottom-right corner, is a small box showing the height and width of the selection.
You can manually edit it to set a specific size.

### Keyboard Control

Ferrishot can be fully keyboard controlled, with no mouse! You can select any region on the screen in just
8 keystrokes. Pick a top-left corner by typing `t`, and pick a bottom-right corner by typing `b`:

We also have vim motions! There is a cheatsheet available by pressing `?` to view the motions:

![cheatsheet](./assets/cheatsheet.webp)

You can see all of the keybindings declared in the default config file [`default.kdl`](./default.kdl)

### Config

Ferrishot is very customizable! You have _full_ control over the UI, color scheme and keybindings.

Create the default config file `ferrishot.kdl` by doing `ferrishot --dump-default-config`.

For reference, see the [default config file (`default.kdl`)](./default.kdl) which contains comments describing each option.

### Command-line interface

Ferrishot is fantastic for usage in scripts. It can be fully controlled without launching a UI.

#### `ferrishot`

A powerful screenshot app

**Usage:** `ferrishot [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

- `-r`, `--region <WxH+X+Y>` — Open with a region pre-selected

  Format: `<width>x<height>+<top-left-x>+<top-left-y>`

  Each value can be absolute.

  - 550 for `x` means top-left corner starts after 550px
  - 100 for `height` means it will be 100px tall

  Each can also be relative to the height (for `y` and `height`) or width (for `width` and `x`)

  - 0.2 for `width` means it region takes up 20% of the width of the image.
  - 0.5 for `y` means the top-left corner will be at the vertical center

  The format can also end with 1 or 2 percentages, which shifts the region relative to the region's size

  - If `width` is `250`, end region with `+30%` to move right by 75px or `-40%` to move left by 100px
  - Supplying 2 percentage at the end like `+30%-10%`, the 1st affects x-offset and the 2nd affects y-offset

  With the above syntax, you can create all the regions you want.

  - `100x1.0+0.5+0-50%`: Create a 100px wide, full height, horizontally centered region
  - `1.0x1.0+0+0`: Create a region that spans the full screen. You can use alias `full` for this

- `-l`, `--last-region` — Use last region
- `-a`, `--accept-on-select <ACTION>` — Accept capture and perform the action as soon as a selection is made

  If holding `ctrl` while you are releasing the left mouse button on the first selection,
  the behavior is cancelled

  It's quite useful to run ferrishot, select a region and have it instantly be copied to the
  clipboard for example. In 90% of situations you won't want to do much post-processing of
  the region and this makes that experience twice as fast. You can always opt-out with `ctrl`

  Using this option with `--region` or `--last-region` will run ferrishot in 'headless mode',
  without making a new window.

  Possible values:

  - `copy`:
    Copy image to the clipboard
  - `save`:
    Save image to a file
  - `upload`:
    Upload image to the internet

- `-d`, `--delay <MILLISECONDS>` — Wait this long before launch
- `-s`, `--save-path <PATH>` — Instead of opening a file picker to save the screenshot, save it to this path instead
- `-D`, `--dump-default-config` — Write contents of the default config to /home/e/.config/ferrishot.kdl
- `-C`, `--config-file <FILE.KDL>` — Use the provided config file

  Default value: `/home/e/.config/ferrishot.kdl`

- `-S`, `--silent` — Run in silent mode. Do not print anything
- `-j`, `--json` — Print in JSON format
