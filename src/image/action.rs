/// The image to save to a file, chosen by the user in a file picker.
///
/// Unfortunately, there is simply no way to communicate something from
/// the inside of an iced application to the outside: i.e. "Return" something
/// from an iced program exiting. So we have to use a global variable for this.
///
/// This global is mutated just *once* at the end of the application's lifetime,
/// when the window closes.
///
/// It is then accessed just *once* to open the file dialog and let the user pick
/// where they want to save their image.
///
/// Yes, at the moment we want this when using Ctrl + S to save as file:
/// 1. Close the application to save the file and generate the image we'll save
/// 2. Open the file explorer, and save the image to the specified path
///
/// When the file explorer is spawned from the inside of an iced window, closing
/// this window will then also close the file explorer. It means that we can't
/// close the window and then spawn an explorer.
///
/// The other option is to have both windows open at the same time. But this
/// would be really odd. First of all, we will need to un-fullscreen the App
/// because the file explorer can spawn under the app.
///
/// This is going to be sub-optimal. Currently, we give off the illusion of
/// drawing shapes and rectangles on top of the desktop. It is not immediately
/// obvious that the app is just another window which is full-screen.
/// Doing the above would break that illusion.
///
/// Ideally, we would be able to spawn a file explorer *above* the window without
/// having to close this. But this seems to not be possible. Perhaps in the
/// future there will be some kind of file explorer Iced widget that we
/// can use instead of the native file explorer.
